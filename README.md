# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Personal touch includes sending emojis. The emojis will be rendered with help of JavaScript inside a div.
User can select any emoji which will be sent to the server. 

The emoji will be sent in the form of utf-8 code. For decoding, I have included following;

import unicodedata as ud

Flask will save the emoji and no changes will be observed in the plain text.
